# Phase 1: Strategy

> Read `methodology/03-phases.md` → "Phase 1" for full requirements.

You are developing the analysis strategy for a **measurement** analysis.

**Start in plan mode.** Before writing any code or prose, produce a plan:
what literature you will query, what samples you expect, what the artifact
structure will be. Execute after the plan is set.

## Output artifact

`outputs/STRATEGY.md` — analysis strategy with physics motivation, sample
inventory, selection approach, systematic plan, and technique selection.

## Methodology references

- Phase requirements: `methodology/03-phases.md` → Phase 1
- Review protocol: `methodology/06-review.md` → §6.2 (4-bot), §6.4
- Artifacts: `methodology/05-artifacts.md`

## RAG queries (mandatory)

Before writing the strategy, query the experiment corpus (via MCP tools):
1. `search_lep_corpus`: prior measurements of the same or similar observables
2. `search_lep_corpus`: standard systematic sources for this analysis technique
3. `compare_measurements`: cross-experiment results if applicable
4. `get_paper`: drill into each reference analysis identified

Cite all retrieved sources in the artifact (paper ID + section).

## Required deliverables

- Physics motivation and observable definition
- Sample inventory (data + MC)
- Selection approach with justification (see "≥2 approaches" below)
- Systematic uncertainty plan
- Literature review from RAG corpus
- **Technique selection** — determine the analysis technique (unfolding,
  template fit, etc.) and justify the choice. This determines which
  technique-specific requirements apply in later phases.

## Applicable conventions

- `conventions/unfolding.md` — for unfolded measurements
- `conventions/extraction.md` — for extraction/counting measurements

The technique selected in Phase 1 determines which file applies.
Read the "When this applies" section of each to confirm.

Read these before writing the systematic plan.

## Key requirements

These are the critical actionable items for Phase 1. See
`methodology/03-phases.md` → Phase 1 for full details.

- **Corpus queries are mandatory.** Query the experiment corpus before
  writing anything — prior measurements, standard systematics, reference
  analyses. Cite all retrieved sources.
- **Enumerate backgrounds.** Classify each as irreducible, reducible, or
  instrumental. Estimate relative importance (order of magnitude is fine).
- **Define discriminating variables.** Identify the variable(s) for final
  statistical interpretation (invariant mass, BDT score, event shape, etc.).
- **≥2 selection approaches must be qualitatively different.** Two
  parametric variants of the same method (e.g., two different IP cuts) do
  NOT count as distinct approaches. At least one approach must be MVA-based
  (BDT on available discriminating variables) unless a concrete constraint
  makes MVA infeasible — in which case the constraint must be documented
  with a [D] label and validated at review. Phase 3 treats cut-based
  selection as a downscope from MVA (see `methodology/12-downscoping.md`),
  so the strategy must at minimum identify what MVA inputs are available
  and why an MVA is or isn't planned.
- **Systematic plan with conventions enumeration.** Read the applicable
  `conventions/` files listed above. For every required source listed, state
  "Will implement" or "Not applicable because [reason]." This enumeration
  is binding — Phase 4a reviews against it. Silent omissions are Category A
  (must-resolve findings that block advancement — see review protocol).
- **Reference analysis table.** Identify 2-3 published analyses closest in
  technique/observable. Tabulate their systematic programs. This table is a
  binding input to later reviews.

**For measurements additionally:**
- Define the observable(s) and their physical interpretation precisely.
- Identify the correction/unfolding strategy and its required inputs.
- Survey prior measurements — published data points become the primary
  validation target in Phase 4.
- Identify theory predictions or MC generators for comparison.
- **Flagship figures.** Identify ~6 figures that would represent the
  measurement in a journal paper. Examples: the final spectrum with
  uncertainties, the response matrix, the key data/MC comparison, the
  systematic breakdown, the theory comparison overlay. These are defined
  here and produced at the highest quality in Phase 5.

## Pre-review self-check

Before submitting for review, verify:

- [ ] Corpus queries executed — at least 3 searches, all results cited
- [ ] Backgrounds classified (irreducible, reducible, instrumental)
- [ ] >=2 qualitatively different selection approaches identified (not
      parametric variants of same method). At least one MVA-based, or
      MVA infeasibility documented with [D] label
- [ ] Systematic plan enumerates EVERY source in applicable conventions
      files: "Will implement" or "Not applicable because [reason]"
- [ ] Reference analysis table: 2-3 analyses with systematic programs
- [ ] Method parity: if references used a more sophisticated method,
      committed to matching it or implementing as cross-check
- [ ] Constraint [A], limitation [L], and decision [D] labels defined
- [ ] For measurements: flagship figures (~6) identified, correction
      strategy defined, theory comparison independence verified

**Your reviewer will check** (§6.4): Backgrounds complete? Systematic
plan covers conventions? Reference analyses tabulated? >=2 qualitatively
different selection approaches (not variants of the same cut)? MVA
considered or infeasibility justified? Method parity with published analyses?

## Review

**4-bot review** — see `methodology/06-review.md` for protocol.
Write findings to `review/{role}/` using session-named files
(see `methodology/appendix-sessions.md` for naming conventions).
