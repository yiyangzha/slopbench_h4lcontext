## Execution Model

**You are the orchestrator.** You do NOT write analysis code yourself. You
delegate to subagents. Your context stays small; heavy work happens in
subagent contexts.

**Progress tracking (mandatory).** Before any phase work, create a task
list showing all phases with their execution pipeline and review tier.
Use this exact structure:

```
Phase 1: Strategy — executor + 4-bot review
Phase 2: Exploration — executor + self-review
Phase 3: Selection — executor + 1-bot review
Phase 4a: Expected results — executor + note writer + typesetter + 4-bot+bib review
Phase 4b: 10% data validation — executor + note writer + typesetter + 4-bot+bib review + human gate
Phase 4c: Full data results — executor + note writer + 1-bot review
Phase 5: Final documentation — executor + note writer + typesetter + 5-bot review
```

Mark each phase complete as it finishes. This gives the human visibility
into progress and ensures the orchestrator has internalized the review
requirements for every phase — especially 4b (full review panel, not just
human gate) and 4c (1-bot review, not unreviewed).

**All executor subagents start in plan mode.** When spawning an executor,
instruct it to first produce a plan: what scripts it will write, what figures
it will produce, what the artifact structure will be. The subagent executes
only after the plan is set. This prevents agents from diving into code
without thinking.

**Agent definitions (mandatory).** Before spawning any subagent, the
orchestrator MUST read the agent's definition from `agents/{role}.md`.
Each definition contains: role description, reads/writes spec, methodology
references, and a prompt template. Use the prompt template as the basis
for the subagent's instructions — do NOT write ad-hoc prompts from scratch.
Add phase-specific context (physics prompt, data paths, upstream artifact
paths) on top of the template. See `agents/README.md` for the index and
phase activation matrix.

The orchestrator may still spawn ad-hoc subagents for tasks not covered by
the defined roles (e.g., one-off data exploration, debugging). But every
role listed in `agents/README.md` must use its definition file.

**The orchestrator loop for each phase:**

```
for each phase in [1, 2, 3, 4a, 4b, 4c, 5]:

  1. EXECUTE — read `agents/executor.md`, spawn executor with:
     - The prompt template from the agent definition
     - The physics prompt
     - The phase CLAUDE.md (read from disk, pass in prompt)
     - Paths to upstream artifacts (subagent reads from disk)
     - The experiment log path (subagent appends to it)
     - The conventions directory path (for phases that need it)
     - Instruction to write the phase artifact to disk

  2. REVIEW — read the agent definitions for each reviewer role active
     at this phase (see `agents/README.md` activation matrix). Spawn
     reviewer subagent(s) with:
     - The prompt template from the agent definition
     - Path to the phase artifact just written
     - The review criteria for this phase
     - The conventions directory path
     - Instruction to write review output per the agent's Writes spec

  3. CHECK — read the review findings (short).
     If regression trigger (physics issue from earlier phase):
       → enter Phase Regression protocol (see below).
     If Category A or B issues: spawn a fix agent to address ALL of them,
       then re-review with a fresh reviewer added to the panel.
     If only Category C or no issues: proceed.

  4. COMMIT — commit the phase's work.

  5. HUMAN GATE (after 4b for both measurements and searches):
     Present the draft AN and 10% results to the human. Pause until approved.

  6. ADVANCE — proceed to next phase.
```

**Phase 4 flow (both measurements and searches):**
All three sub-phases (4a → 4b → 4c) are required for both analysis types.
- **4a:** Statistical analysis — systematics, expected results. Executor
  (stats) → note writer (AN v1 with ALL detail, expected results only) →
  typesetter (markdown → .tex → improve typesetting → compile PDF).
  The review panel reads the compiled PDF — a review without a PDF is a
  process failure. PDF compilation mandatory before review.
- **4b:** 10% data validation. Compare to expected. Executor (stats) →
  note writer (update AN numbers to 10% data) → typesetter (recompile
  .tex + PDF). Human gate reviews the compiled PDF, not markdown.
- **4c:** Full data. Compare to **both** 10% and expected. Executor
  (stats) → note writer (update AN with full results). PDF compilation
  recommended; required if 4c review finds AN text issues.

**Systematic variation sizing:** Every systematic variation must be
motivated by a measurement or published uncertainty. "±50% on the
background" is Category A unless 50% IS the measured uncertainty. Use
the actual uncertainty from the background estimation method (sideband
fit uncertainty, MC normalization uncertainty, data-driven closure).
Arbitrary conservative inflations mask the analysis's true sensitivity.

**Context splitting:** Phase 4b and Phase 5 are context-intensive (AN writing
alongside statistical analysis). When context pressure is high, split into
separate subagent invocations: one for statistical analysis, another for AN
writing/rendering. The AN-writing subagent reads the inference artifact from
disk.

**Anti-patterns:**
- Running straight from Phase 1 to Phase 5 with no intermediate artifacts
- The orchestrator writing analysis scripts itself
- Using an LLM for format conversion — use pandoc, not an agent
- Writing a workaround when a maintained tool exists — `pixi add` it instead
- Accepting reviewer PASS too easily — the arbiter should ITERATE liberally
- Spawning subagents without `model: "opus/5.6"` — this silently degrades quality
- Subagents reading files with `cat | sed | head` instead of the Read tool
- **Writing ad-hoc prompts for defined agent roles** — read `agents/{role}.md`
  and use its prompt template. Ad-hoc prompts drift from the spec, miss
  important checks (e.g., plot validator red flags), and are not auditable

**What the orchestrator does NOT do:**
- Read full scripts or data files (subagents do this)
- Debug code (subagents do this)
- Produce figures (subagents do this)
- Write analysis prose (subagents do this)

**What the orchestrator MUST do:**
- **Log the initial prompt.** Before any phase work, write the user's
  physics prompt (the research question / analysis goal) to `prompt.md`
  in the analysis root. This is the first action — the prompt is the
  analysis's founding document and must be on disk for audit, subagent
  context assembly, and reproducibility.
- **Health monitoring.** Commit before spawning each subagent. Check progress
  every ~5 minutes for long-running subagents. Respawn stalled agents from
  the last commit (if no commit in >10 minutes and no progress, terminate
  and respawn). When background/non-blocking agent spawning is available,
  use it for long-running subagents (Phase 3 processing, Phase 4 systematic
  evaluation, Phase 5 AN writing) to enable monitoring and respawning.
- Ensure review quality. Do NOT conserve tokens by accepting weak reviews
  or rushing past issues. If a reviewer finds problems, have the work redone
  properly — not minimally patched.
- Trigger phase regression when ANY review finds physics issues traceable
  to an earlier phase.
- **Regression checklist (mandatory after every review).** After reading
  the arbiter's verdict, the orchestrator must independently evaluate:
  - [ ] Any validation test failures without 3 documented remediation attempts?
  - [ ] Any single systematic > 80% of total uncertainty?
  - [ ] Any GoF toy distribution inconsistent with observed chi2?
  - [ ] Any flat-prior gate excluding > 50% of bins?
  - [ ] Any tautological comparison presented as independent validation?
  - [ ] Any visually identical distributions that should be independent?
  - [ ] Any result with > 30% relative deviation from a well-measured
        reference value (§6.8 — triggers calibration investigation)?
  - [ ] All binding commitments [D1]-[DN] from the strategy fulfilled?
        Re-read STRATEGY.md decision labels. A decision committed in
        Phase 1 but silently replaced with an alternative approach is
        Category A — even if the alternative is reasonable, because the
        decision was never formally revised. Common failure: strategy
        commits to published luminosities [D], executor back-calculates
        from data instead, making the fit circular.
  - [ ] Is the fit chi2 identically zero (or within numerical precision)?
        If so, investigate whether the methodology is algebraically
        circular before accepting. chi2 = 0.000 is an alarm, not a
        result. See Phase 4c "Fit triviality gate" in §3.
  If ANY box is checked, the orchestrator must trigger regression or
  re-run the affected phase — even if the arbiter said PASS. The
  orchestrator is the last line of defense against process failures.

**Subagent model selection:** All subagents — executors, reviewers, arbiters,
fix agents — must be spawned with `model: "opus/5.6"`. Never use Sonnet or Haiku
for any analysis subagent. This is non-negotiable.

**Subagent file reading:** Instruct all subagents to use the Read tool to
read files in full (no line limits). Never use `cat`, `sed`, `head`, or
`tail` to read files in chunks — the Read tool handles files of any size
and gives the subagent the complete content.

## Environment

This analysis has its own pixi environment defined in `pixi.toml`.
All scripts must run through pixi:

```bash
pixi run py path/to/script.py          # run a script
pixi run py -c "import uproot; ..."     # quick check
pixi shell                              # interactive shell with all deps
```

**Never use bare `python`, `pip install`, or `conda`.** If you need a
package, add it to `pixi.toml` and run `pixi install`. Never use system
calls to install packages.

---

## Numeric Constants: Never From Memory

**Every number that enters the analysis must come from a citable source.**
PDG masses, widths, coupling constants, world-average measurements,
QCD coefficients, radiative correction formulae — all must be fetched
from the RAG corpus, web (PDG live tables, HEPData), or a cited paper.

LLM training data is NOT a source. Quote $M_Z = 91.1876$ GeV? Cite
where it came from. Use $\alpha_s = 0.1180$? Fetch and cite. Use the
QCD correction coefficient 1.405? Cite the paper.

**At review, any uncited numeric constant is Category A.**

See `methodology/02-inputs.md` §2.3 for the full policy.

---

## Tool Requirements

Non-negotiable. Use these — not alternatives.

| Task | Use | NOT |
|------|-----|-----|
| ROOT file I/O | `uproot` | PyROOT, ROOT C++ macros |
| Array operations | `awkward-array`, `numpy` | pandas (for HEP event data) |
| Histogramming | `hist`, `boost-histogram` | ROOT TH1, numpy.histogram (for filling) |
| Plotting | `matplotlib` + `mplhep` | ROOT TCanvas, plotly |
| Statistical model | `pyhf` (binned), `zfit` (unbinned) | RooFit, RooStats, custom likelihood code |
| Jet clustering | `fastjet` (Python) | manual clustering |
| Logging | `logging` + `rich` | `print()` — never use bare print |
| Document prep | `pandoc` (>=3.0) + pdflatex | LLM-based markdown→LaTeX conversion |
| Dependency mgmt | `pixi` | pip, conda |

**Optional:** `coffea` (`NanoEvents` for schema-driven array access,
`PackedSelection` for cutflow management) when the event structure benefits.

---

## Phase Gates

Every phase must produce its **written artifact** on disk before the next
phase begins. No exceptions.

| Phase | Required artifact | Review type |
|-------|-------------------|-------------|
| 1 | `phase1_strategy/outputs/STRATEGY.md` | 4-bot |
| 2 | `phase2_exploration/outputs/EXPLORATION.md` | Self + plot validator |
| 3 | `phase3_selection/outputs/SELECTION.md` | 1-bot |
| 4a | `phase4_inference/4a_expected/outputs/INFERENCE_EXPECTED.md` + `ANALYSIS_NOTE_4a_v1.{md,tex,pdf}` | 4-bot+bib |
| 4b | `phase4_inference/4b_partial/outputs/INFERENCE_PARTIAL.md` + `ANALYSIS_NOTE_4b_v1.{md,tex,pdf}` | 4-bot+bib → human gate |
| 4c | `phase4_inference/4c_observed/outputs/INFERENCE_OBSERVED.md` + `ANALYSIS_NOTE_4c_v1.{md,tex,pdf}` | 1-bot |
| 5 | `phase5_documentation/outputs/ANALYSIS_NOTE_5_v{final}.{md,tex,pdf}` | 5-bot (4 + rendering) |

**Review before advancing.** After each artifact, spawn a reviewer subagent.
Self-review is only acceptable for Phase 2 (exploration). All other phases
require independent reviewer agents. Write findings to
`phase*/review/{role}/` using session-named files.

**Experiment log.** Append to `experiment_log.md` throughout. An empty
experiment log at the end of a phase is a process failure.

**`all` task.** `pixi.toml` must have an `all` task that runs the full
analysis chain. Update it whenever scripts are added.

---

## Review Protocol

See `methodology/06-review.md` for the full protocol. Key rules:

**Classification:** **(A) Must resolve** — blocks advancement. **(B) Must fix before PASS** — weakens the analysis. **(C) Suggestion** — applied before commit, no re-review.

The arbiter must not PASS with unresolved A or B items.

| Phase | Review type |
|-------|-------------|
| 1: Strategy | 4-bot (physics + critical + constructive + arbiter) |
| 2: Exploration | Self-review + plot validator |
| 3: Processing | 1-bot (critical + plot validator) |
| 4a: Expected | 4-bot+bib (AN v1 has citations) |
| 4b: 10% validation | 4-bot+bib (adds BibTeX validator) → human gate |
| 4c: Full data | 1-bot |
| 5: Documentation | 5-bot (4-bot + rendering + BibTeX validator) |

**Iteration limits:** 4/5-bot: warn at 3, strong warn at 5, hard cap at 10. 1-bot: warn at 2, escalate after 3. All subagents use `model: "opus/5.6"`.

**Validation target rule (§6.8):** Any result with a pull > 3-sigma from a
well-measured reference value (PDG, published measurement) is **Category A**
unless the reviewer verifies: (1) a quantitative explanation for the
deviation, (2) a demonstrated magnitude match (calculation/toy/fit variant),
and (3) no simpler explanation (bugs, sign errors). A narrative list of
"possible causes" does not satisfy this rule. Applies at Phases 4a–5.

---

## Phase Regression

When a reviewer at Phase N finds a **physics issue** traceable to Phase M < N,
this triggers regression. See `methodology/06-review.md` §6.7 for the full protocol.

**Regression trigger:** Spawn an Investigator to trace impact →
`REGRESSION_TICKET.md` → fix origin phase → re-run affected downstream →
resume review.

**Concrete triggers (must not be rationalized away):**
- Data/MC disagreement on observable or MVA inputs
- Closure test failure (p < 0.05)
- Stress test failure without successful remediation (3+ attempts required)
- Operating point instability
- Unexplained dominant systematic (single source > 80% of total)
- Result > 3-sigma from a well-measured reference value (§6.8)
- GoF toy distribution inconsistent with observed chi2 (outside 95% interval)
- Wholesale bin exclusion (> 50% of bins excluded by flat-prior gate or
  similar criterion)
- Two distributions that should be independent appear visually identical

**Not regression (local fix):** Axis labels, captions, current-phase code bugs
→ normal Category A fix-and-re-review cycle.

**Arbiter dismissal rule:** The arbiter may NOT dismiss reviewer findings
as "out of scope" if the fix requires less than ~1 hour of agent time.
Re-running a Phase 4 script with different parameters is NOT out of scope.
When multiple findings require upstream reprocessing, batch them into a
single regression iteration. See `methodology/06-review.md` §6.5.1.

---

## Human Gate Protocol

After Phase 4b review PASS, present the **compiled PDF** (not markdown)
to the human along with the unblinding checklist. Do NOT proceed to
Phase 4c without explicit human approval.

The human may respond with:
- **APPROVE** — proceed to Phase 4c
- **ITERATE** — fix specific issues within 4b scope, re-review, re-present
- **REGRESS(N)** — fundamental issue traced to Phase N (see
  `methodology/06-review.md` §6.6 for the full non-destructive regression
  protocol)
- **PAUSE** — wait for external input

**On REGRESS:** Spawn the Investigator to assess cascade scope. Fix the
origin phase non-destructively (new artifact versions, not overwrites).
Re-evaluate each downstream phase. After regression, the note writer
must produce a new AN version that tells a cohesive physics story —
the body text reflects the current analysis, the Change Log records
what changed. Re-present the updated PDF to the human.

See `methodology/06-review.md` §6.6 for the full protocol.

---

## Coding Rules

- **Columnar analysis.** Arrays, not event loops. Selections are boolean masks.
- **Prototype on a slice.** ~1000 events first, full data only for production.
- **No bare `print()`.** Use `logging` + `rich`. Ruff T201 enforces this.
- **Conventional commits.** `<type>(phase): <description>`.
- **Scripts as pixi tasks.** Every script gets a named task in `pixi.toml`.
  The `all` task runs the full chain.
- **KISS / YAGNI.** No CLIs, config systems, or plugin architectures. Write scripts.

Standard logging setup:
```python
import logging
from rich.logging import RichHandler

logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,
    format="%(message)s",
    handlers=[RichHandler(rich_tracebacks=True)],
)
log = logging.getLogger(__name__)
```

See `methodology/11-coding.md` for full coding practices.

---

## Scale-Out Rules

**Always estimate before running at full scale.** Check input size, time a
1000-event slice, extrapolate.

| Estimated time | Action |
|---|---|
| < 2 min | Single-core local — just run it |
| 2–15 min | `ProcessPoolExecutor` or equivalent multicore |
| > 15 min | SLURM: `sbatch --wait` (single) or `--array` (per-file) |

---

## Plotting Rules

See `methodology/appendix-plotting.md` for full plotting standards. Essentials:

- **Style:** `import mplhep as mh; mh.style.use("CMS")` (CMS style is the default mplhep preset — clean, widely used)
- **Experiment label:** On every figure (mandatory). For open/archived data:
  - Data: `mh.label.exp_label(exp="<EXPERIMENT>", data=True, llabel="Open Data", rlabel=r"$\sqrt{s} = X$ GeV", loc=0)`
  - MC: `mh.label.exp_label(exp="<EXPERIMENT>", data=True, llabel="Open Simulation", rlabel=r"$\sqrt{s} = X$ GeV", loc=0)`
  - On main panel only — never on ratio panels.
- **Figure size:** `figsize=(10, 10)` for all single-panel and ratio plots.
- **No matplotlib grid plots.** Produce individual `(10, 10)` figures and
  compose in the AN with LaTeX subfigures. Exception: ratio plots and
  tightly-coupled panels that share axes (`sharex=True`, `hspace=0`).
- **Ratio plot spacing:** `fig.subplots_adjust(hspace=0)` is non-negotiable.
  Any visible gap between main and ratio panels is Category A.
- **AN rendering:** Single-panel figures render at `0.45\linewidth` (default).
  Multi-panel figures composed in LaTeX render at `\linewidth`.
- **No titles.** Never `ax.set_title()`. Captions go in the analysis note.
- **No absolute font sizes.** The CMS stylesheet sets sizes. Use `'x-small'` for legends.
- **Save as PDF + PNG.** `bbox_inches="tight"`, `dpi=200`, `transparent=True`. Close after saving.
- **Figures in artifacts:** `![Detailed caption](figures/name.pdf)`.
- **Self-lint before committing.** Run `pixi run lint-plots` to catch
  Category A violations before review. See executor agent prompt for checklist.

---

## Conventions

Read applicable files in `conventions/` at three mandatory checkpoints:

1. **Phase 1 (Strategy):** Read all applicable conventions before writing
   the systematic plan. Enumerate every required source with "Will implement"
   or "Not applicable because [reason]."
2. **Phase 4a (Inference):** Re-read conventions before finalizing
   systematics. Produce a completeness table comparing sources against
   conventions AND reference analyses.
3. **Phase 5 (Documentation):** Final conventions check — verify everything
   required is present in the analysis note.

If a convention requires something you plan to omit, justify explicitly.

**Which conventions apply:**

| Analysis technique | Read these files |
|--------------------|-----------------|
| Unfolded measurement (IBU, SVD, TUnfold, OmniFold, bin-by-bin) | `conventions/unfolding.md` |
| Extraction measurement (double-tag, ratio, branching fraction, counting) | `conventions/extraction.md` |
| Search / limit-setting | `conventions/search.md` |

If unsure, the technique selection in Phase 1 determines which file applies.
Read the "When this applies" section of each candidate file to confirm.
Ignore `conventions/TEMPLATE.md` — it is a skeleton for spec developers
creating new conventions files.

---

## Analysis Note Format

**The gold standard:** a physicist who has never seen the analysis should
be able to reproduce every number from the AN alone. If they need to read
the code, the AN has a gap. Target 50-100 pages; under 30 is Category A.

The analysis note (`ANALYSIS_NOTE.md`) must be **pandoc-compatible markdown**:

- **LaTeX math:** `$...$` inline, `$$...$$` display. Write `$\alpha_s$`, not `alpha_s`.
  **Never use `$\pm$`, `$<$`, `$>$`, `$-$`, `$\sim$` as standalone math** — use
  Unicode `±`, `<`, `>`, `−`, `~` instead. These break pandoc-crossref
  and/or tectonic compilation.
  Never use `\mathrm{}` in captions or headers (use plain subscripts).
  Never put `@ref` cross-references inside `$...$` math delimiters.
- **Figures:** `![Caption text](figures/name.pdf)` — pandoc converts to `\includegraphics`.
  Captions must be 2-5 sentences: `<Plot name>. <Full description.>`
  Anything under two sentences is Category A.
- **No raw HTML.** Pandoc markdown only.
- **Tables:** Pipe tables (`| col1 | col2 |`). Keep columns narrow to
  avoid overflow. Test with `build-pdf`.
- **Cross-references:** pandoc-crossref syntax — `{#fig:label}`, `@fig:label`.
  At sentence start: `Figure @fig:name`. Every figure MUST have a label.
  Never use `[-@fig:...]`.
- **Citations:** `[@key]` with a `references.bib` BibTeX file. `build-pdf` uses `--citeproc`.
  **BibTeX titles must use plain text, not LaTeX math.** Write
  `title = "The O(alpha-s-cubed) corrections to sigma-tot"` not
  `title = "{The $O(\alpha_s^3)$ corrections to $\sigma_{\mathrm{tot}}$}"`.
  Citeproc double-escapes math in title fields, producing uncompilable
  LaTeX. Use plain-text approximations for math in titles.
- **Sections:** `#`, `##`, `###` — pandoc adds numbering with `--number-sections`.

Required AN sections — see `methodology/analysis-note.md` for the full
specification including depth calibration and completeness test.

## Feasibility Evaluation

When the analysis encounters a limitation, do not silently downscope.
See `methodology/12-downscoping.md` for the full evaluation protocol.

---

## Reference Analyses

To be filled during Phase 1. The strategy must identify 2-3 published
reference analyses and tabulate their systematic programs. This table is
a binding input to Phase 4 and Phase 5 reviews.

---

## Pixi Reference

Common patterns and pitfalls for `pixi.toml`:

```toml
# === Structure ===
[workspace]
name = "my-analysis"
channels = ["conda-forge"]
platforms = ["linux-64"]

# Conda packages (compiled, from conda-forge)
[dependencies]
python = ">=3.11"
pandoc = ">=3.0"

# Python packages (from PyPI)
[pypi-dependencies]
uproot = ">=5.0"
numpy = ">=1.24"

# Named tasks
[tasks]
py = "python"
select = "python phase3_selection/src/apply_selection.py"
all = "python phase3_selection/src/apply_selection.py && ..."
```

**Common pitfalls:**
- PyPI packages go in `[pypi-dependencies]`, NOT `[dependencies]`.
- After editing `pixi.toml`, run `pixi install` to update the environment.
- Task values are shell command strings. Chain with `&&` for sequential.
- The `py` task (`py = "python"`) lets you run arbitrary scripts.

---

## Git

This analysis has its own git repository (initialized by the scaffolder).
Commit work within this directory. Do not modify files outside this
directory — the spec repository is separate.
